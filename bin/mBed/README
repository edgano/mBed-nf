COMPILATION
============================================================

Unpack the source, cd into the newly created directory and type 
$ make
This will (hopefully) create a binary called mBed

We tested mBed on Ubuntu 9.04 and Debian 5.0.4 using gcc 4.3.



USAGE
============================================================

Type
$ ./mBed  -help
to get some command line  argument help etc.

The only required command-line argument is -infile FILE, where FILE should point to a multiple sequence file.
mBed's default behavior is to create a guide tree called infile.dnd in the directory of the input file and a
distance matrix called distMat.out in the current working directory.



COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
============================================================

Output of mbed -help:

typical usage: ./mBed [-infile pathToInputFile] [-speed speed] [-clustering clusteringType] [-method methodType] [-numInputSeeds number] [-numOutputDims number] [-useSeedsOnly true] [-findOutliers true] [-seedSelection method] [-seedTreatment method] [-evaluate False][-evaluate2 False] 

where:
 [-speed] can be either fast or slow (default = fast)
 [-clustering] can be either upgma, kmeans, hybrid or none (default = upgma).
 [-method] can be either SparseMap or SeedMap or FullMatrix
 (default = FullMatrix).
 [-numInputSeeds] is the number of initial seed sequences to use to start the pre-processing (SeedMap).
 [-numOutputDims] is the final number of output dimensions (SeedMap, SparseMap).
                  It embeds the sequences with respect to the first k reference groups. 
 [-useSeedsOnly] is 'true' by default; forces the program to embed all sequences using just the seeds.
 [-findOutliers] is 'true' by default; setting it as 'false' will gain speed (but may lose accuracy.)
 [-seedSelection] may be 'naive','single', 'medoids' or 'multi'. This defines how the seeds are chosen.
 [-seedSelection] may be 'naive','bySeqLen','bySeqDist' or 'bySeqFeats'. This defines how the seeds are treated.
 [-evaluate] allows you to test the resultant vectors by correlation with the orginal distances
 

If you do not specify any options, then the program will create a full distance matrix and upgma tree by default
